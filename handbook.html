                    <h3>Key Management</h3>
                    <p> Proper key management is required as a part of a cleaning service company. The company should ensure the security of client’s properties and the safety of employees. Neat n Tidy is maintaining a proper key management to keep the cleaning process smoothly. Neat n Tidy has four full time employees and eight part time employees. Keeping the key securely and accessibly is very crucial for Neat n Tidy since it should be readily available for those who need them. Key control system has been implemented in Neat n Tidy where only authorized personnel have the access to keys. 
                        Company could designate one or more full-time employees as key controller. They are responsible for retrieving and issuing keys from the locker. Part time workers has to request the key when required and return the key safely when required. As per the company policy a key can be always accompanied by full time employees. <br>
                        It is important to establish a robust key management system. The key controllers should be trained in key management best practices and ensure that each team has the keys they need before they leave the office. To track the keys company has implemented a key tracking system which is accessible for both full time and part time workers. This indicate who has access to which key and when. This is an automated system and can be accessed via below url. <br>

                        If you did not get a mail with the credentials to the above system, please send a mail to IT admin team. This automated system use electronic key fobs to track the access. 
                        The company has a secure locker or cabinet where keys are kept when not in use. This locker should be located in a secure area with limited access, and only authorized personnel should have access to it.
                        Regular audits are in place to ensure that the keys are being used responsibly and secured preventing unauthorized access.

                    <h3>Observing and Supervising</h3>

                    <h3>Customer Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Client management is a crucial aspect of running a successful cleaning service company like Neat N Tidy. The company must ensure that its clients are satisfied with the cleaning services provided and their expectations are met or exceeded. The following are five essential factors for effective client management in a cleaning service company:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            communication is key. Neat N Tidy must ensure that there is clear communication between the company and its clients. This includes responding promptly to client inquiries, addressing any concerns or complaints, and providing regular updates on cleaning schedules and progress.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The company should maintain a high standard of cleaning. The cleaning staff must be trained to deliver quality cleaning services, using appropriate cleaning techniques and products. Neat N Tidy should also periodically evaluate its cleaning standards to ensure they meet or exceed industry benchmarks and client expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The company should focus on building long-term relationships with its clients. By understanding their clients' needs and preferences, Neat N Tidy can tailor its services to meet their specific requirements. The company should also solicit feedback from clients regularly to identify areas for improvement and continually enhance its services.
